# BotMan DialogFlowV2 Middleware

This Package is used to connect Google Assistant with [BotMan](https://github.com/botman/botman).

It is a drop-in replacement for the Google Assistant driver.

It has been tested and is still working as of July, 2021.

All credit to [@mpociot](https://github.com/mpociot), [@barryvdh](https://github.com/barryvdh) and others who made the google assistant driver available. Minor changes had to be done to get the current Google Assistant working, hence I wanted to help others by putting their contribution on the packgists. The code was sourced from his [botman/driver-google-assistant](https://github.com/botman/driver-google-assistant).

## Installation

composer require op/botman-studio-driver-google-assistant-v2
